This repository contains codes related to Time Series, covering the following assignments and projects:

Individual Assignment 1: The assignment aims to fit an appropriate ARIMA model for the ‘wwwusage’ time series data which consists of the number of users connected to the internet through a server.

Individual Assignment 2: The assignment aims to fit an appropriate ARIMA model for the daily historical Apple stock prices from February 1, 2002 to January 31, 2017 which is extracted from the Yahoo Finance website.
